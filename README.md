The goal of this lab work is to develop our first artificial neuron using Python and Numpy, 
without using any specific deep learning framework. This exercise will help you understand 
the fundamental concepts of a neural network and implement a simple neural model from scratch.
Objectives
Understand the Basics of Neural Networks:
Learn how artificial neurons work.
Understand the basic architecture of a neural network and how a neuron computes an output.

Implement a Perceptron:
Implement the Perceptron algorithm, a basic form of a neural network that can solve binary classification tasks.
Focus on weight initialization, activation function, and weight updates based on the error.

Use Python and Numpy:
Use Python for scripting and Numpy for handling arrays and matrix operations efficiently.
Avoid using specialized deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to get a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics.
